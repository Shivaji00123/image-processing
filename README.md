1a-Image Resizing:
Image resizing is the process of changing the dimensions (width and height) of an image. It is commonly used in computer vision, machine learning, and graphics applications to standardize image sizes, reduce storage, and improve processing speed.

1b-Image Rotation:
Image rotation is the process of turning an image around its center by a specified angle. It is widely used in computer vision, image augmentation, object detection, and robotics to handle different orientations of objects.

1c-Image Translation:
Image translation is the process of shifting an image horizontally, vertically, or both. It moves the pixel locations without altering their values, effectively repositioning the image within a new coordinate space.

1d-Image Normalization:
Image normalization is the process of adjusting the pixel intensity values of an image to a common range. This enhances contrast, improves computational efficiency, and ensures consistency in machine learning models and computer vision tasks.

1e-Edge detection of Image:
Edge detection is a fundamental technique in image processing used to identify boundaries within an image. It highlights regions where intensity changes sharply, making it useful for object detection, segmentation, and feature extraction.

1f-Image Blurring:
Image blurring is a technique used to reduce sharp edges and noise in an image by averaging pixel values within a defined neighborhood. It is commonly used in preprocessing, noise reduction, and artistic effects.

1g-Morphological Image Processing:
Morphological image processing is a technique used to process binary and grayscale images based on shapes. It applies operations using a structuring element to extract, modify, or analyze image components like edges, boundaries, and objects.

1h-Image Processing:
Image processing is a technique used to manipulate, analyze, and enhance images to extract meaningful information. It involves applying algorithms to an image for improvement, analysis, or transformation.
